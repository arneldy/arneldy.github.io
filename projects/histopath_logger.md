title: 'Histopath Logger & Paps Logger'
---

Histopath Logger is a simple Python script that scans through histopathology reports in Word doc and docx format and outputs a list in a csv file.

Paps Logger does the same thing but is made to read Pap smear reports.

It's a script I wrote during residency when the laboratory needed a way to quickly log a number of old reports written in Word doc and docx format.

Just a simple executable. Nothing fancy.
